This Project uses KerasNLP and Tensorflow for Sentiment Analysis of SPOT Surveys using data from RateMyProfessors. 

The inspiration behind this project comes from my first experience of giving CMPUT 291 lectures to undergraduate students at the University of Alberta. 
Teaching Assistants get feedback from students at the end of the semester through SPOT surveys. However these survery are mainly oriented towards the lab sessions conducted by the TAs.
With the hopes of gaining commentary feedback on the lectures from the students, the main motivation behind this project was to train NLP models on data from RateMyProfessors, and use the models to predict/generate a rating based on comments left in SPOT Surveys. 

Note : Source code is currently not runnable as the data required to train the models cannot be public as it breaches RateMyProfessors TOS.
